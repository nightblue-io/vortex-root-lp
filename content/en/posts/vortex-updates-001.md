Quick updates on Vortex:

Vortex can now run on Kubernetes and normal VMs. It can intercept your LLM prompts and responses and do checks and validations for additional security, without the need to change your applications at all.

For now, it's limited to apps that use OpenSSL behind the scenes (Python, curl), and NodeJS-based apps, which have their own TLS stack. We're working on Go-based apps (which also have their own TLS stack) at the moment, and more, soon.
